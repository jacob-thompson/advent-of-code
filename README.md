Welcome to my repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions! This project contains my Python solutions for the daily coding challenges of Advent of Code, an annual programming event held during December.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
ðŸ“‚ advent-of-code
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ yearYYYY
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ dayXX
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py  # Python solution for the day's challenge
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt    # Puzzle input
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md    # Description of the day's problem
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- **`yearYYYY`**: Each folder corresponds to a specific year of Advent of Code (e.g., `year2024`).
- **`dayXX`**: Subfolders for each day of the event, containing the solution and any relevant files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can verify your Python version by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacob-thompson/advent-of-code.git
cd advent-of-code
```

### Running Solutions

Navigate to the folder for the specific year, then execute the `dayx.py` file:

```bash
cd yearYYYY
python3 dayXX.py
```

Replace `YYYY` and `XX` with the desired year and day.

### Testing with Different Inputs

You can replace the content of `dayXX.txt` with your own puzzle input to test the solution for other cases.
