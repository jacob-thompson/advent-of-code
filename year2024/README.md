Welcome to the solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges! This directory contains my Python implementations for all puzzles from the Advent of Code event for the year 2024.

## Directory Structure

```
ðŸ“‚ year2024
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ day01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py  # Python solution for Day 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt    # Puzzle input for Day 1
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md    # Problem description or notes
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ day02
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each folder corresponds to a specific day of Advent of Code 2024. Inside each folder:
- `solution.py`: Python script containing the solution to the day's puzzle.
- `input.txt`: The puzzle input for that day.
- `README.md` : Notes or details about the problem and solution.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the appropriate day directory and execute the `solution.py` script:

```bash
cd dayXX
python3 solution.py
```

Replace `XX` with the day number (e.g., `01` for Day 1).

### Running All Solutions

To run all of the solutions, execute the `all.py` script:

```bash
python3 all.py
```

## Testing with Different Inputs

If you want to test a solution with a different input, replace the contents of the `input.txt` file in the corresponding day directory.

## Progress

| Day | Status        |
|-----|---------------|
| 1   | âœ… Completed  |
| 2   | âœ… Completed  |
| 3   | âœ… Completed  |
| 4   | âœ… Completed  |
| 5   | ðŸš§ In Progress|
| ... | ...           |

## Notes

Advent of Code puzzles are a fun way to practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. The solutions here are my own implementations and may not always be the most optimized but are functional and tailored to the given inputs.
